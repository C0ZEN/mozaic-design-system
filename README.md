# Adeo's Design System 
> ADEO - LMF - LMBR | Design System Team

**Why:** The goal is to speed up the workflow of designers and developers by providing well designed, developed and documented visual components.

**What:** Source of truth which groups all the elements that will allow the teams to design, realize and develop a product

---------------------------------

## Summary

A design system unites product teams around a common visual language. It reduces design debt, accelerates the design process, and builds bridges between teams working in concert to bring products to life.
we've just started, so videos and screenshots will be available soon...

## Concepts

- [Garden, from Leroy Merlin Brazil](http://styleguide.leroymerlin.com.br),
- [Design System Leroy Merlin France](http://design-system.leroymerlin.fr),
- Cosmos, from Leroy Merlin Spain and others.
